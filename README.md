This is the documentation for BÃ¼nd Flutter task
## Getting Started

The code is currently functioning well for the 'Years' tab. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I haven't had the opportunity to implement the 'Weeks' and 'Days' functions yet. I've attached screenshots and documentation that outline how I've approached and completed this task. As of now, I've primarily focused on the 'Years' tab's functionality and appearance.
